# Programmers' Czech Keyboard Layout for Mac 🇨🇿

This layout modifies the Czech keyboard on macOS so that the top row of keys (`1`, `2`,
`3`, … `0`) always types numbers without requiring the `⬆Shift` key, while characters
such as `ě`, `š`, `č`, `ř`, `ž`, `ý`, `á`, `í`, and `é` are accessible by holding
`⬆Shift`.

## Why Another Repository?

I could not find any existing layout that worked properly, so I created my own.

## How It Was Created

The layout was created using [Ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/), based on the
original Czech keyboard layout.

Tested and created on macOS 15.4.1.

## Installation

1. Copy the layout file `Programmers Czech.keylayout` to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
2. Add it in System Settings:
    - `System Settings` → `Keyboard` → `Input Sources` → `Edit...` → `+` → Select
      "Programmers Czech"

## Maintenance

This layout is considered complete. No further updates are planned unless the Czech
keyboard layout itself changes in future macOS versions.
